# Full-Stack Conventions

Cross-cutting skills in `.github/skills/fullstack/`:

- E2E testing: `playwright-cli`

## API Proxy (Dev)

The Next.js frontend proxies `/api/*` requests to the .NET backend at `http://localhost:5001`. This is configured in `src/web/next.config.ts`.

# Golden Rules

- Make small, correct, reviewable changes
- Keep diffs minimal; don't refactor unrelated code
- Prefer existing repo patterns over general best practices
- Don't add dependencies unless clearly necessary

# Backend Testing Conventions

You have access to skills in `.github/skills/backend/` for project-specific best practices. **YOU MUST** use the `testing` skill before writing or modifying tests.

## Principles

1. **Test-First** — Write tests before implementation. Red → Green → Refactor.
2. **xUnit** — All backend tests use xUnit as the test framework.
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert** — Structure every test with clear AAA sections.

## Quality Bar

```bash
dotnet test        # All tests pass
```
